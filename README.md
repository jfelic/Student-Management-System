# Project Description:

## You are a Database Admin for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.

## Your application should do the following:
-Ask the user how many students will be added to the database.
-The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student.
-The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
## A student can enroll in the following courses:
-History 101

-Mathematics 101
-English 101
-Chemistry 101
-Computer Science 101

-Each course costs $600 to enroll
-The student should be able to view their balanace and pay tuition.
